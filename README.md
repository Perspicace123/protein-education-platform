# 3D Protein Structure Interactive Learning Platform

Platform Introduction
A 3D protein interactive learning platform for middle school biology education. Here, students can directly explore the three-dimensional structure of proteins through intuitive operations, observe the interactions between molecules, and make abstract biological concepts vivid and visible.

Platform Features
"Intuitive interaction.
-360 ° free rotation, zooming and translation of protein structures
- One-click switch between multiple visualization styles (ball stick models, cartoons, surfaces, etc.)
Click to view detailed information about a specific molecule or residue

"Education-friendly"
The interface is simple and clean, the operation is easy, and no professional knowledge is required
Pre-set multiple observation perspectives and teaching scenarios
Explain the relationship between structure and function by combining specific protein examples

Safe and reliable
- ** Completely free **, with no commercial use at all
We do not collect users' personal information
- Based on the authoritative protein structure database (RCSB PDB

Teaching Example: HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR)
"Learning Objectives
Understand the three-dimensional spatial structure of proteins
2. Understand the interaction between proteins and small molecule ligands
3. Observe post-translational modifications (glycosylation) of proteins
4. Understand the biological principle that "structure determines function"

"Explore Content"
- ** Protein main body ** : HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR)
- ** Modification sites ** : Independent exploration

How to use
"Basic Operations"

-For Local
